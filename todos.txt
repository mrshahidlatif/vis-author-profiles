-Daniel A. Keim don't have focus areas. Why???
-special information on non-vis author (may be * and more info like author not in database)

Fabian's Feedback - Suggestions / Things to do
----------------------------------------------
-Determine the gender of a first name (https://genderize.io/#singleusage)
	(I just realized that we currently count CoRR/arxiv publications as journal articles. This is misleading/incorrect. Often people use arxiv just to publish preprints. Sebastian Baltes is an example. I suggest we just ignore all CoRR/arxiv publications – although we might miss a few “real” publications, we get rid of all the preprints)
-PROBLEMS IN PROFILES OF OUR TEST CANDIDATES
	 
	Ji Soo Yi
	Jacko *is* the most frequent co-author, but *was* the supervisor – I believe this sentence need greater variety for covering, for instance, ongoing supervision vs. past supervision (only if we are sure that it is past). A more tricky case is past supervision, but ongoing collaboration.
	Kwon and Kim are the same category of co-authors with a comparable number of joint publications with Yi – it would probably sound much if we could summarize them.


LAYOUT 

-Add a 5 px margin so that the bottom line of the text is on the same height as the south-west-west/south-east-east corner of the badge

-Text should describe the authors within the visualization

TODOs

Appearance 


Functionality 
-NLG : Handle the case where 2nd and 3rd top coauthors have same no. of publications 
-Stephan Diel is a good example having 3 top coauthors and three of them are his supervisees
-Exception handling when record of author is not found

-Add DOI to publications 


MISC 
-take care of duplicated functions with different names 
	+ e.g. getAuthorObjectByName() in visualization.js & findAuthorObjectByName() in nlg.js
