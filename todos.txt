Fabian's Feedback - Suggestions / Things to do
----------------------------------------------
-we have “he” in the second standard sentence. We should replace it with the name or “the author” [FIXED]
-Determine the gender of a first name (https://genderize.io/#singleusage)
-And „conference papers“ should better be named “proceedings papers” (this category also comprises “workshops”, “symposiums”, “meetings”, etc.)
	(I just realized that we currently count CoRR/arxiv publications as journal articles. This is misleading/incorrect. Often people use arxiv just to publish preprints. Sebastian Baltes is an example. I suggest we just ignore all CoRR/arxiv publications – although we might miss a few “real” publications, we get rid of all the preprints)
-Subgroups of co-authors
-Collaboration graph for those authors who have no coauthor in VIS community e.g. Roch Guerin 
-PROBLEMS IN PROFILES OF OUR TEST CANDIDATES
	R. Jordan Crouser
	We should never say or stress that a collaboration ended at a certain year (that sounds too final - it might have continued, but we don’t know that). We can provide a range of joint publications instead (e.g., “with 10 joint publications between 2003 and 2010”). But only if the last publication is more than 5(?) years ago, I would provide an end year.
	 
	Ji Soo Yi
	Yi is active too long (> 10 years) to have the first author information [FIXED]
	Maybe, “top collaborator” is too imprecise and we should replace at least the first instance with “most frequent co-author”.
	Jacko *is* the most frequent co-author, but *was* the supervisor – I believe this sentence need greater variety for covering, for instance, ongoing supervision vs. past supervision (only if we are sure that it is past). A more tricky case is past supervision, but ongoing collaboration.
	Kwon and Kim are the same category of co-authors with a comparable number of joint publications with Yi – it would probably sound much if we could summarize them.
	 
	Michael Bostock [FIXED]
	Bostock is not publishing anymore. We need to change the first sentence to, for instance, “Bostock published between 2009 and 2011.” But actually, I would prefer to merge the first two sentences to, for instance, “Bostock published six publications between 2009 and 2011, including five journal articles and one conference paper.” (beware the singular for the conference paper; what about writing numbers twelve/ten and smaller as words? However, we should be consistent within a sentence or maybe a paragraph - https://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-rules-for-writing-numbers-and-numerals/ )

-“conference paper(s)” -> “proceedings paper(s)” [FIXED]
-“active researcher/contributor” + since year + present perfect if publication within last two years (and more than 5 years and 10 publications); span + past tense if last -publication more than 5 years ago; since year + present perfect else
-“longtime contributor” if more than 20 years in business
-Only one sentence usually instead of two to describe #publications and type. Maybe, if somebody has more than 100 publications, we might start rounding (by 50ies) to kind of -highlight this achievement and split the first sentence into two sentences. (Roch Guérin)
-“journal paper” -> “journal article” (Ovidiu Ancuta)
-Maybe flip proceedings and journal if #proceedings > #journal
-more similar authors in second paragraphs

LAYOUT 
-Fill a somewhat wider area with the main content, i.e., text plus side bar (e.g., Stackoverflow: 1090px; Google Scholar: 1200) [FIXED]
-Move the VAP logo to the left before the search field [FIXED]
-Align the author name (title) on the left [FIXED]
-Add a 10 px margin between the author name and the badges
-Add a 5 px margin so that the bottom line of the text is on the same height as the south-west-west/south-east-east corner of the badge
-Make the default gray font color lighter that the difference between clickable text and non-interactive text becomes clearer [FIXED IN DIFFERENT WAY]
-Don’t let the side bar have a separate scrollbar (that sometimes gives two scoll bars, which can be confusing), but just increase the height of the page [FIXED]
-Add a page title so that the browser tab shows a nice label, e.g., “[author name] – VAP” [FIXED]
-Reduce the size of the logo so that it has a larger margin within the grey bar [FIXED]
-Change the font of “VIS Author Profiles” in the logo to the one used in the page (not sure it looks better, but the current font of the logo doesn’t fit really)
-Correction: I didn’t mean a larger space between the badges, but between the author name and the first badge only. It should be at least the size as between two badges (currently it is half the size).
-Make the badges a bit larger 
-Have a larger space between the text and the side bar [FIXED]
-There is an unnecessary ~20px margin on the right side of the side bar [FIXED]
-Don’t use bold font for the title of a publication because it is not clickable – maybe try italics instead [FIXED]
-Remove the footer (because double-blind submission) [FIXED]
-Only two labels for x-axis and 1 for y (only the max value on the right)
-Text should describe the authors within the visualization

Functionality 
-NLG : Handle the case where 2nd and 3rd top coauthors have same no. of publications 
-Stephan Diel is a good example having 3 top coauthors and three of them are his supervisees
-Handle if the author has more than 2 supervisors 
-Making author sparklines interactive 
-Exception handling when record of author is not found
-add button to load second tier coauthors [DONE]
-link names in central graphic to load record function
[Priority:High]-Integrate the VIS publications 
-show number of publication after the name of author in the central graphic, i.e. John A. (32)
[Priority:High]-fix the height of bar for each author in the central graphic
-Author badges based on statistics e.g. Supervised Student, Active Years, No of publications etc. [IN PROCESS]
-First Author publication count (Pay attention to alphabatical order in some conferences) [DONE]
-add venues of conferences 
[Priority:High]-Handle cases when top collaborator, supervisor, active collaborator or supvisee overlap in NLG.js [DONE]
-Add DOI to publications 


MISC 
-take care of duplicated functions with different names 
	+ e.g. getAuthorObjectByName() in visualization.js & findAuthorObjectByName() in nlg.js
